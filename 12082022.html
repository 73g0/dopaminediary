			<p>For me, minimalism is about understanding something so well that you are able to reduce it to only its fundamentals.
			<br><br>
			I am currently writing a cheat sheet for my upcoming physics exam at university and I am obsessed with keeping it minimalistic in order to have all the fundamentals that I might need during the exam and at the same time be sure that it is not cluttered with unnecessary information that would keep the important stuff hidden.
			<br><br>
			I believe that minimalism is the way to live. From simple stuff like my wardrobe to difficult stuff like the words I say, I try to keep it as simple as possible without loosing the fundamentaly important.
			<br><br>
			Trying to be minimalistic encourages you to deep dive into a topic and try to filter out the important stuff without being overwhelmed by the amount of information you are trying to comprehend!
