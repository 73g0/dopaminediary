			<p>According to Wikipedia, "Dopamine is a neuromodulatory molecule that plays several important roles in cells." and you will know how important those roles are when you listen to the "Huberman Lab"-podcast by Andrew Huberman, which is a podcast I highly recommend.
			<br>
			<br>
			Strongly simplified, everybody has their unique baseline of dopamine. Life is a constant cycle of dopamine-levels above and below this baseline. A high peak is followed by a deep low and will slowly make its way back to the baseline, e.g. if you party hard, you will experience several peaks of dopamine, the happy feeling, which are then followed by lows the next morning, the hangover.
			<br>
			<br>
			As mentioned above, dopamine plays several important roles in cells. On top of your feelings, dopamine is very important for learning and memory. Again, strongly simplified, when you learn new things, the neurons involved in the learning episode grow new projections and form stronger connections. Science has shown that if you peak your dopamine levels shortly after you have learned something, the formation of new neurons and the strengthening of the conncections become even stronger, i.e. you will memorize better.
			<br>
			<br>
			When I learned about this, I started to experiment. Drinking my coffee after studying seemed logical, because drinking coffee peaks dopamine, but it wasn't, because I needed the coffee in order to be alert and be able to process the information I wanted to learn.
			<br>
			I started to think about the highest peaks of dopamine I would have during a normal day and ended up with getting physically active directly after studying.
			Until now, I can not say that this has helped me to memorize better, because the test period is too short, but I can definitely say that it has boosted my motivation, because I have a peak to look forward to while studying!
