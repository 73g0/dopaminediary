			<br>
			<p>There are two types of nutrients that you need: macro and micro.
			<br>
			The macro nutrients are proteins, carbohydrates and fats and the micro ones are vitamins and minerals.
			<br><br>
			In order to be healthy, your body needs the right amount of all of the above.
			The exact amount is individual for everyone and depends on several factors, e.g. height, muscle mass, fat mass, if you want to gain or loose either of those masses and much more.
			<br>
			I recommend using a calorie-counter-app for one month in order to get to know your daily calorie goals and then align your food with those goals.
			<br><br>
			When buying food, I always think in macros and micros and try to find the right balance in every meal. This not only makes cooking much more fun, but also ensures that I am doing my best in order to be healthy!
