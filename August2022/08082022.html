			<h4>8th of August, 2022</h4>
			<br>
			<p>I don't have a problem with waking up early and getting physically active first thing in the morning. I really enjoy a workout in the gym before the "real" day has started.
			<br>
			While doing so I have realized that there is a major problem with doing so: I am tired.
			<br>
			The reason for my tiredness is that I only know flat out in the gym. When I was a teenager I watched the famous Arnold-video where he is giving advice by saying: "You gotta shock se muscle!". Since then that has been my attitude in the gym.
			<br><br>
			This tiredness has led to a decrease in willpower and therefore indiscipline and a quest to search for the best morning-activity.
			<br><br>
			I have read from, listened to or watched someone talk about the benefits of a sunrise-run just as often as I have told myself to try it.
			<br>
			Today was a first. I woke up before sunrise, put on my running gear and ran.
			<br>
			I ran 7 km in 45 minutes with an average heart rate of 120 bpm, came back home, took a cold shower and started my day feeling highly motivated and full of energy!
			Part of the motivation was definitely caused by the "first" aspect but the energy came from the run.
			<br><br>
			I play a lot of golf, therefore I know not to think that I have found the key to something, because the next day this key won't unlock the same doors as yesterday but I know that I am so bad at running that I don't have any expectations and am therefore not tempted to go flat out.
			<br>
			The perfect setting for a morning activity!
