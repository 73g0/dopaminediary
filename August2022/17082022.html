			<p>Everything starts at the beginning but the journey only starts there ;).
			<br>
			What I mean by that is that starting is something that you obviously have to do in order to progress at something but don't be fooled by all the people saying that starting is the hardest part. In my opinion that is the easiest part, supported by the fresh will to achieve something. The hard part of the journey comes with the first things that don't go as imagined.
			<br>
			It is in those moments where you will find out how much you want to achieve something!
