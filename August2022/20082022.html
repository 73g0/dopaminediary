			<h4>20th of August, 2022</h4>
			<br>
			<p>There is only thing that one needs to understand: "Just do it!" is all you need in life.
			<br>
			If you think about everytime you were in a situtation that was followed by one of these "if I only had done this..." moments then living by Nikes slogan would have done good to you.
			<br>
			Of course it is much easier said than done to live this principle and I wish I could give tips on how to do it, but I still struggle to live by it every day.
			<br>
			Nevertheless, I am certain that it all comes down to one thing and that is just doing it.
			<br>
			There will never be a way around it and nobody will do it for you.
			<br><br>
			Just do it!
