			<h4>14th of August, 2022</h4>
			<br>
			<p>In the book "Atomic Habits", James Clear introduces a principle called habit stacking.
			<br><br>
			You wake up and want to turn off your alarm but you can't do it because you placed it at the other end of the room behind a chair in order to force you out of bed in the morning. It worked.
			You are up and your heart rate shoots up because you have to get active in order to get to the alarm which you placed beneath the book you wanted to read 10 pages from during the day.
			<br>
			Since you already have it in hand you read the 10 pages and on the last line of the 10th page you see a handwritten note saying: "Look in the closet! :)". You open the closet and find your running outfit fully prepared with a banana and a piece of chocolate on top of it. This reminds you that you wanted to go for an easy activation run after waking up. You eat the chocolate, get dressed and while heading for the door you eat the banana, drink some water and run.
			<br>
			After a nice run...
			<br><br>
			That's how habit stacking works!
			The better your preparation, the easier it will feel to fall from one habit into the next!
			<br>
			Try to think of new creative ways to motivate yourself and trick yourself into doing what you would normally not like to do. It is fun!
