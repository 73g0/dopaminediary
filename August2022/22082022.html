			<h4>22nd of August, 2022</h4>
			<br>
			<p>I am currently preparing for my exams for this semester at university and am spending most of my time studying right now.
			I often arrive at a point where my brain simply doesn't want to absorb any more information and I find myself rereading the same sentence over and again or my brain being distracted by the tiniest noises, etc..
			<br>
			I have realized that taking mini-breaks in the form of a short walk to the toilet or to get some water or doing some push-ups is sufficient in order to regain focus and be able to study again.
			<br>
			The longer I study the more mini-breaks I have to take and at some point not even the mini-breaks help anymore. This is the time where I get physically active and therefore take a longer break in order to go to the gym or for a run!
