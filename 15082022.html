			<h4>15th of August, 2022</h4>
			<br>
			<p>If you see someone win (doesn't matter in which way), you are tempted to think that there was a shortcut involved.
			<br>
			Your brain always searches for the path of least resistance even if it is not the truth and in the winning case it is very convenient to assume there was a shortcut involved because you only know very little to nothing about the winner and how if not with the help of a shortcut should he/she be able to achieve something that you can't (at the moment)?
			<br>
			It is only when you win yourself that you realize how much work is needed in order to get there.
			It is consistent effort that will lead you to a win and not a shortcut because the journey is the reward or in other words, the consistent effort is what enables you to do something that other only dream of.
			<br>
			The win itself is just the moment where the others realize what you are capable of!
