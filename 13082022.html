			<h4>13th of August, 2022</h4>
			<br>
			<p>I am addicted to media consumption. I've tried many different approaches to minimize my consumption but I have always found myself in the same spot after some time, which is that I don't have control.
			<br>
			I know that there always is the one moment in which you decide to "press play", sometimes literally and sometimes in the form of starting an application but I am not able to isolate this moment and really think about wether I want to do what I am about to do and how it will affect my life.
			<br><br>
			Don't get me wrong. Media consumption can be very relaxing and good in order to wind down but the reason why I want to minimize the time I spend on media consumption is that I could use this time for things that are even better for e.g. relaxation.
			<br>
			<br>
			I will start with only podcast consumption for today and will try to ramp up slowly!
