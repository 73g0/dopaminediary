			<h4>10th of August, 2022</h4>
			<br>
			<p>Watch the YouTube-video "Navy Seal Commander explains why wake up at 4am" from Casey Neistat.
			<br>
			At one point in the video Casey states that purpose is what it's all about and he is right!
			<br><br>
			In the past I have tried very often to wake up very early in the morning consistently and I have also failed very often.
			I have read books, watched videos or listened to podcasts about how to do it and have come to the conclusion that everything comes down to one realization: You need a purpose!
			<br>
			You need a purpose that is strong enough to get you out of bed without hesitation and without a thought about how tired you are.
			<br>
			This purpose should be a "SMART" goal (specific, measurable, attainable, realistic, fixed time frame).
			For me goals like "be able to run 10km in a single run in one month", which would tick all the SMART boxes is not urgent enough.
			I need goals that I can achieve directly after the effort, e.g. "run 5km before 07:00 in order to be awake and alert for studying". I recommend trying this approach. It feels like a superpower!
